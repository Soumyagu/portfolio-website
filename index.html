        <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
<p>
  This is a personal portfolio website created as part of my Micro IT Internship.  
  It is designed to highlight my academic background, technical skills, and project work.  
  The site is built using HTML and CSS, with a clean and responsive layout.  
  It includes dedicated sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact information.  
  I created this project to build my online presence as a budding web developer.  
  The "About Me" section introduces who I am and what Im passionate about.  
  The "Projects" section provides brief details of the technical work Iâ€™ve done.  
  The "Contact" section includes my email and links to GitHub and LinkedIn.  
  This project helped me understand web structure and responsive design better.  
  It reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growing in web development.
